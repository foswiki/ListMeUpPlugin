---+ List Me Up Plugin

This plugin offers a REST interface and is usually called in a XHR environment. It is used to add/remove items to/from a list stored in the meta data of a topic (formfields, topic settings etc).

Using this plugin you have to perform only a single step to manipulate a list instead of ping-pong data between the webserver and the webbrowser. 


---++ Motivation
Let's say you have a [[System.DataForms][DataForm]] named !EventForm and a field called _Attendees_ within that form which holds a comma-separated list of names. You want to offer an "Add me" button for your users to put themselves onto the list of Attendees.

Your javascript behind the button has to perform three steps: 
   1 get the current list of attendees, 
   1 manipulate the list within the browser and 
   1 write back the new compiled list. 
If there is a delay between step 1 and 3 (for whatever reason), another user may interfere and raise an update anomaly.


---++ Example
See Sandbox.PluginTestListMeUpPlugin (!JQueryPlugin needed).

---++ REST interface
%I% *Note:* You have to be authenticated and use HTTP POST requests for all verbs.

---+++ =add= / =remove= verb
| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =webtopic= | Web.Topic, location where the list is stored. | _none_ |
| =name= | Name of the list (ie. field name of preference name) | _none_ |
| =type= | List type (=FIELD=, =PREFERENCE= or any custom type) | =FIELD= |
| =item= | Value to be added/removed to/from the list. %BR% On =remove= all instances of =item= will be removed. Empty entries will be removed. | _none_ |
| =separator= | Seperator between items in the list | =,&nbsp;= |
| =split= | Regex how to split up the list | =[,\s]+= |
| =duplicate= | Allow duplicate items to be added to the list. This does not affect duplicates which are already there. | =off= |
| =sort= | Sort the list. | =off= |

Possible return codes:

| *Code* | *Text* |
| 200 | Ok |
| 400 | Missing parameter 'webtopic'. |
| 400 | Missing parameter 'name'. |
| 400 | Missing parameter 'item'. |
| 403 | Forbidden. |
| 404 | Topic not found. |
| 404 | Metadata not found. |
| 500 | Error saving topic. |

The handler may return a =200 Ok= even if nothing was changed (due to a duplicate).
